Title: Subset of BAM files of human tumor and pooled normal sequencing
        data (Zhao et al. 2014) for the NGScopy package
Description: Subset of BAM files of human lung tumor and pooled normal
        samples by targeted panel sequencing. [Zhao et al 2014.
        Targeted Sequencing in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Using
        the University of North Carolina (UNC) Sequencing Assay
        Captures Most Previously Described Genetic Aberrations in
        NSCLC. In preparation.] Each sample is a 10 percent random
        subsample drawn from the original sequencing data. The pooled
        normal sample has been rescaled accroding to the total number
        of normal samples in the "pool". Here provided is the
        subsampled data on chr6 (hg19).
